# Contributing to OpenMeet
Hi and welcome to OpenMeet contributing guidelines! First of all we want to thank you for investing your time and efforts into our project ❤️. <br>
If you are not familiar with the project, we suggest to checkout the wiki where we describe the structure of the OpenMeet and if you are really interested in knowing all the engigneering process behind OpenMeet you can checkout the documentation:

## How to submit changes
In order to submit changes to the project, please open **pull request** where you describe the changes you have made and why you have made those changes. <br>
The basic steps required to open a pull request are the following: 
- Fork the [main repository](https://github.com/sl1mSha4dey/openMeet_Classe03); 
- Clone your fork onto your machine; 
- Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-features'`; 
- Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Brief description"`; 
- Push to the branch: `git push origin my-features`; 
- Open up a pull request and explain what you did; 

Since the project is structured into multiple apps and directories, when you want to make a change on the code the name of your branch should start with the app or directory you are intend to modify. Example, if you want to make changes to the webapp, your branch should be called `webapp-my-changes`. 

### I don't know how pull requests work
If it's your first time contributing to a project on Github don't worry! Github's got you covered! Follow the guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to understand what pull requests are, how they work and why they are useful. 

## How to report a bug 
To report a bug don't try to fix it on your own! First, open up an issue, describe what the bug you found is and your possible solution to it. <br> 
Before reporting a bug make sure it's not already been reported. 

### I don't know what an issue is
Once again, Github got you covered! Follow the guide [here](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues) to understand what issues are and why the are useful. 

### Why should I open an issue in order to fix a bug?
Opening up an issue notifies the community of the existence of the bug; you can discuss with more experienced members and find the best solution together.
